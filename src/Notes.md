Common Pitfalls

* Rename geojson files to .json (quirk for CRA, it's only been configured to handle jsons by default)

* if the data doesn't show up, make sure to check that 
1) it's formatted correctly. there can be weird null values in raw data downloaded from govt sites
2) try to increase the visibility of the visuals of the layer (set a huge stroke, a fill in a bright color, etc). 
   be outrageous. sometimes it's just a matter of having the right zoom level.

* use mapshaper to visualize data
